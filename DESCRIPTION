Description: Calculates different parameters for weather stations used in micrometeorology (with 2 measurement heights).
  Can estimate radiation balance, calculates soil heat flux from soil temperature measurements, calculates turbulent fluxes 
  (Bowen Ratio, Penman, Priestley-Taylor) and much more.
